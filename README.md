## Hello!

I'm TIny_Hacker and I program calculators! I mostly use TI-BASIC, though currently I'm learning C on my TI-84 + CE and I hope to learn more languages in the future. Occasionally I make things but usually I'm just lazy. Don't look at any of my code because it is absolutely horrible, have fun, and enjoy your stay! I like to make things with GIMP, and I also am a big fan of retro games and Pokemon Rom Hacks. If you're still reading down here, you should stop, because I don't have anything else to say. See you around!
