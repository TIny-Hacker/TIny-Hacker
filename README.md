## Hello!

I'm TIny_Hacker and I program calculators! I'm currently working on ~a super cool project~ nothing, but I might make something else neat in the future! In the mean time, be sure to ~check out my past projects~ not look at any of my code because it is absolutely horrible, have fun, and enjoy your stay! I like to make things with GIMP, and I also am a big fan of retro games and Pokemon Rom Hacks. If you're still reading down here, you should stop, because I don't have anything else to say. See you around!
